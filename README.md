## My first website using plain html and css
This is the first website I'm building using only HTML5 and CSS3.<br />
<br />
I am extremely happy I worked on this, with the help of a course - CODE WITH MOSH. I was able to learn so many things like how to easily center items using flexbox, how to layout out objects/items using grid, amongst other things.<br />
<br />
This website I worked on has really strengthened my knowledge on HTML and CSS💪💪.<br />
<br />
I gained a lot of valuable experience from this project and I'll really like it if you can send me a chat on linkedIn telling me what you think😁.
